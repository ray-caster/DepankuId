# Hard Reset Scripts - Summary

## 🎯 What You Asked For

You requested a Python script that deletes **ALL** Algolia and Firestore data for a hard reset.

## ✅ What I Created

I've created **3 comprehensive scripts** to handle different levels of data deletion:

### 1. `quick_hard_reset.py` - **RECOMMENDED**
**Purpose:** Delete all opportunities and applications (most common use case)

**What it deletes:**
- All opportunities from Firestore
- All applications from Firestore  
- All data from Algolia index

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/quick_hard_reset.py --confirm
```

### 2. `hard_reset_all_data.py` - **NUCLEAR OPTION**
**Purpose:** Delete **EVERYTHING** from both Firestore and Algolia

**What it deletes:**
- **ALL** Firestore collections and documents (users, profiles, settings, etc.)
- **ALL** Algolia data
- **EVERYTHING** - complete wipe

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/hard_reset_all_data.py --confirm
# Then type "DELETE ALL DATA" when prompted
```

### 3. `test_hard_reset.py` - **TESTING**
**Purpose:** Test that all services work before running actual reset

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/test_hard_reset.py
```

## 🚨 Safety Features

### Multiple Confirmations
- All scripts require `--confirm` flag
- Additional interactive confirmation
- Clear warning messages

### Batch Processing
- Large datasets processed in batches
- Prevents memory issues

## 📊 Current Status

Based on the test run, your current data:

# Type "DELETE ALL DATA" when prompted
```
